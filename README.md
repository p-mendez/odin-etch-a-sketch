# The Odin Project's Etch-A-Sketch Project

Etch-A-Sketch is a web application that allows users to draw and sketch on a grid of squares. It's a fun project for practicing DOM manipulation and working with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This project is inspired by a combination of a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch toy.

## Features
* Create a 16x16 grid of square divs.
* Generate the grid using JavaScript, avoiding manual HTML creation.
* Use flexbox to arrange the grid squares in a grid layout.
* Implement a hover effect, changing the color of the squares as the mouse passes over them.
* Add a button to the top of the screen to prompt the user for a new grid size.
* Limit the user input for grid size to a maximum of 100 to prevent performance issues.
* Toggle random color mode, which randomizes the RGB value of the squares on each interaction.
* Implement progressive darkening mode, gradually adding black or color to the squares with each interaction until they become completely black after ten interactions.

## Usage
* Move your mouse cursor over the grid squares to draw and create patterns.
* Click the "Create New Grid" button to generate a new grid with a different size.
* Toggle the "Random Colors On/Off" button to switch between random color mode.
* Toggle the "Progressive Darkening Mode On/Off" button to enable or disable progressive darkening mode.
